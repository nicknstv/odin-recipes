Hello!
I am Nikola and this is my first assignment from the curriculum of The Odin Project.
I will be just using HTML to create a recipe website. It won't look appealing but once I complete the lessons covering CSS, I will give it a good look as well. Let's see what I've learnt so far.
Cheers,
Nikola
